## About Me

Hello! I'm Matin, the creator of **PricePal**. You can learn more about me and my projects on my website: [matin.codes](https://matin.codes).

I developed PricePal to address the common frustration of finding the best prices across multiple stores. By leveraging the MERN stack and modern mobile technologies, I aim to provide users with a seamless and efficient shopping experience.

Feel free to reach out through GitHub or visit my website for more information!

## Introduction

**PricePal** is an open-source, full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application designed to help users find the best prices for items across various stores. The frontend is built using **React Native** with **Expo Router**, providing a seamless mobile experience, while the backend handles data scraping, database management, and more.

## Demo

*Coming Soon!* A live demo of PricePal will be available shortly. Stay tuned!

## Technologies

- **React Native:** For building the mobile frontend.
- **Expo Router:** Simplifies navigation within the app.
- **MongoDB:** Database management.
- **Axios:** Handling HTTP requests.
- **React Native Elements:** UI components.
- **Puppteer:** Web scraping.
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js:** Installed on your machine. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Expo CLI:** Installed globally. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- **Git:** Installed on your machine. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Configuration

1. **Backend Setup:**
   
   PricePal Frontend communicates with the backend for data fetching and management. Ensure you have the [PricePal Backend](https://github.com/decompi/pricepal-backend) set up and running.

2. **Environment Variables:**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.com/api
   EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY="yourapikey:
   ```
   
   Replace `https://your-backend-url.com/api` with the actual URL where your backend is hosted.
   Replace `yourapikey` with the actual API Key you set for your backend.
